File structure is complete mostly the only question is where scripts should go? I personally prefer inside the scene folder along
with the scene associated with it

also i added the script ide plugin but that is personal preference if you want to enable it yourself or use an external ide
also for resources the base should be next to the folder not inside and any derivitives should be inside the folder 

thanks!
